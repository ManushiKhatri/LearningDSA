Steps for solving bfs problems:


1. Determine if graph, if not make it
2. Make our base cases
3. Create tracking variables
4. Intake start or first level (in shortest path we also want to intake the start path)
5. Process Q
    1. Process node
    2. Check if Iâ€™ve been here before
    3. See if I have solved the problem#returns if exists 
    4. Process neighbors
